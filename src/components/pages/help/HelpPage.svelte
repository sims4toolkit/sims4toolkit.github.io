      This website should cover everything you need to get started using the
      Sims 4 Toolkit library, but if you're stuck on something, I'm happy to
      help. Reach out to me
      <a href={discordLink} target="_blank">on Discord</a>.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>
      If you're completely stuck on how to begin using S4TK, please refer to
      <a href="https://patreon.frankkmods.com" target="_blank"
        >this post on Patreon</a
      >
      for a basic introduction to creating a Node.js project and running JS/TS code.
    </p> -->
    <p>
      Please note that I will NOT be offering any further help with Node.js,
      npm, JavaScript, or TypeScript. There are so, so, so many resources
      available to learn them online. Please restrict your questions to those
      pertaining to S4TK specifically.
