# sims4toolkit.github.io

Documentation website for Sims 4 Toolkit.

## Disclaimer

This website was thrown together in just a few days, and not much planning went into it. The main priorities were "make thing work" and "publish thing fast", so the code has inevitably turned into a heaping plate of spaghetti. The spaghetti appears to work just fine, but if you notice it misbehaving, please [open an issue](https://github.com/sims4toolkit/sims4toolkit.github.io/issues) or [let me know on Discord](https://discord.gg/qNhD3Jh).

This website will likely be re-written entirely at some point, since the urgency of developing it won't be as high.
